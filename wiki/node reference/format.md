# Node reference: Format (String / Multiline)

**[>> Link to the tutorials](../tutorials/Format/)**

## Overview

The `Format` nodes are very simple yet powerful nodes, that are based on the **standard Python string `format()` method**.\
They exist in 2 flavors: `String` or `Multiline`.

They are useful to create a string from a template, and **any number of inputs**.

> [!NOTE]
> Inputs can be of the following ComfyUI types: `STRING`, `INT`, `FLOAT`, `BOOLEAN`.

In addition to the standard Python format syntax, this extension supports a
small safe expression syntax for string values. This is also available in XY
Plot header formats.

## How to use

Here we will just cover the most basic usage, but please note that Python string `format()` allows to do very interesting things, beyond the standard string replacement: padding, truncating, ...

### Simple usage

The node takes any number of inputs, that are automatically incremented: `arg0`, `arg1`, ...

Given the following template: `first arg by name: {arg0}, second by index: {1}`, and 2 input strings (`tata` and `toto`), we will get the resulting string: `first arg by name: tata, second by index: toto`.

Here we see that **we can reference the inputs either by their name (`argN`), or by their index (starting at 0)**.\
Straightforward, isn't it?

> [!TIP]
> This way, it's **very simple to concatenate 2 strings, append text to a string, pad / truncate, ... many operations in one single node!**

### String expressions

The following expressions can be used inside a placeholder:

| expression | result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `{arg0[:20]}` | first 20 characters |
| `{arg0[10:]}` | everything after the first 10 characters |
| `{arg0.replace("old", "new")}` | replace a specific string |
| `{arg0.removeprefix("prefix_")}` | remove a matching prefix |
| `{arg0.removesuffix(".png")}` | remove a matching suffix |

Only indexing, slicing, and approved string methods are accepted; arbitrary
Python expressions are not evaluated. Existing format specifications continue
to work, such as `{arg1:g}` or `{arg0:.20s}`.

And last but not least: at stated above, it can take **other types than strings: integer, float, boolean** (and surely others).
